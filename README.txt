Very simple vancouver transit utility that takes advantage of the Translink API. 

TODO: 
- Support for specific routes at a stop 
- Refresh button 
- Better organize classes, especially DepartureDataFetch, maybe make new class to handle parsing 
- Search for nearby stops  
- Cleaner list (maybe a table) 
- Settings for changing amount of results / maximum amount of time from departure
